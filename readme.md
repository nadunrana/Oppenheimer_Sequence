# Oppenheimer Sequence GUI Documentation

The "Oppenheimer Sequence" GUI is a graphical user interface that allows players to play a challenging game where they need to decipher a 4-digit code before the timer runs out. The game is an interactive experience inspired by historical events related to Robert Oppenheimer and his creation, the bomb.

## Game Objective

The player's objective is to crack the 4-digit code by using clues provided in the game. The game features a countdown timer that adds urgency to the gameplay. The player must enter their guess before time runs out to win the game.

## Game Instructions

To start a new game round, the player can press the 'Play' button or the spacebar. A clue will be displayed, and the player needs to figure out the 4-digit code based on that clue. The game provides a series of images as a countdown animation during the timer. Players have two input options for convenience:

- Enter digits (0-9) using the numpad buttons to input the code.
- Press 'p' or the Enter key to submit the code as PASS.
- Press 'c' or the Backspace key to clear the entered code (CLR).

The game will display the remaining time and the estimated time for impact through the "Timer Label" during gameplay. If the player successfully enters the correct code before the timer reaches zero, they win the game and are shown a victory image. If the timer runs out before the correct code is entered, the player loses, and a failure image is displayed.
