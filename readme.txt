Oppenheimer Sequence GUI Documentation

The "Oppenheimer Sequence" GUI is a graphical user interface that allows players to play a challenging game where they
need to decipher a 4-digit code before the timer runs out. The game is based on a historical context related to Robert
ppenheimer and his creation, the bomb.

Game Objective:
The player's objective is to crack the 4-digit code by using clues provided in the game. The game provides a countdown
timer that adds urgency to the gameplay. The player must enter their guess before time runs out to win the game.

Game Instructions:
When the player presses the 'Play' button or the spacebar, a clue will be displayed, and they need to figure out the
4-digit code based on that clue. The game will show a series of images as a countdown animation during the timer.
Players can use the numpad buttons or the keyboard for faster input:

Enter digits (0-9) to input the code.
Press 'p' or Enter Key to submit the code as PASS.
Press 'c' or Backspace to clear the entered code (CLR).
The game will notify the player about the remaining time and the estimated time for impact through the "Timer Label"
during gameplay. If the player successfully enters the correct code before the timer reaches zero, they win the game
and are shown a victory image. If the timer runs out before the correct code is entered, the player loses, and a
failure image is displayed.
